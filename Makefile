# Delete the builtin make rules, as if "make -r" was used.
.SUFFIXES:

# Ask make to not delete "intermediate" results, such as the .o in the chain
# .cc -> .o -> .so. Otherwise, during the first build, make considers the .o
# to be intermediate, and deletes it, but the newly-created ".d" files lists
# the ".o" as a target - so it needs to be created again on the second make.
# See commit fac05c95 for a longer explanation.
.SECONDARY:

# Deleting partially-build targets on error should be the default, but it
# isn't, for historical reasons, so we need to turn it on explicitly...
